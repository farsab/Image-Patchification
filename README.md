# Vision Mamba: Image Patchification for Transformers

## Project Title
Patchify: Transform Images into Patches for Vision Transformers

## Description
This module introduces image patchification, a key preprocessing step for vision transformers (ViTs). It divides an image into non-overlapping patches, preparing it for transformer-based models that operate on patch sequences instead of full images.

## Dataset
- Input: Any RGB image at path `images/input.jpg`
- The demo resizes the image to 224x224 and splits it into 16x16 patches
